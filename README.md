# p5jsStarterKit

Hello!

Welcome to the p5js starter kit.
It's a collection of functions meant to kickstart or inspire your next p5.js project.

You can start coding anytime with the p5.js web editor at
	https://editor.p5js.org/tmcelmeel/sketches/uAOFwhqD5

There's an interactive reference site you can use to find the functions you need at
	https://helloitisthomas.github.io/p5jsStarterKitReference/

You can also download the code for this kit at
	https://github.com/helloItIsThomas/p5jsStarterKit
There's a link to the reference site source code on my page as well.

Feel free to contact me with any questions, bugs, or just to say hi at
